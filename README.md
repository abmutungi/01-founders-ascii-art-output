### Ascii-Art Output Project

This repository contains files from a project completed at 01 Founders Coding School.

The objective is to build upon [Ascii-Art program](https://github.com/abmutungi/01-founders-ascii-art) and allow the user to write the output into a text file.

This project introduced me to :

- The Go file system(fs) API
- Data manipulation
